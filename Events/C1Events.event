//AFEV 0x8 PrepAIChange 0x01 //Not sure what you were trying to do here, explain this to me and I will implement this in a modern form that's easier for people these days to debug/understand
//explanation:
//Player fights boss, boss says "argh! what are you waiting for?! get on them already!!",
//and the boss quote runs the event PrepAIChange which sets a temporary flag that is checked for at
//the beginning of each player phase (by the turn event AIChangeifBossFought) starting from phase 2.
//If this flag is true, enemies' AI changes to 0 (pursue) and the flag is set to false so the event will not run again.
//This construction is necessary as opposed to just making the boss quote do the CHAI directly because changing AI
//in the middle of a turn could potentially cheaply catch the player off guard, especially if moving a unit to fight the boss
//was the last thing they did in their turn.
//There is probably some more elegant way of implementing this that I'm not aware of. I'm used to having to bootstrap from FE7.

//Let me know what we want to call these enemies and I'll set up any definitions we need.
//note: in-world they are bandits; generally I will refer to generic bad guys by byte rather than name
//because e.g. 0x66 is more descriptive ("got it; it's that character slot in particular") than Bandit1 ("it's... one of many bandits, huh")
