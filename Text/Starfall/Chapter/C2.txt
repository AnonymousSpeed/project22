[LoadMidLeft]The village is coming into view, Solomin.[NL]
... It likes as dire as the others.[A][X]
[LoadMidRight]... We should investigate.[NL]
There may be survivors.[A][NL]
Be on your guard.[NL]
I'll ride ahead to scout.[A][X]
[LoadMidRight][ClearSolomin]
[LoadMidLeft][CloseEyes]...[NL]
What has become of my home?[A][NL][OpenEyes]
No time for such talk, Esme.[NL]
You've been through worse.[A][NL]
Challenges are opportunities by[NL]
another time, are they not?[A]
Surely, we will find others and get[NL]
to the bottom of this mess.[A]
Yes, that sounds like a much more[NL]
palatable outcome.[A][X]
[OpenFarFarRight]Lady Esme![NL]
There are survivors. Let's ride![A][X]
[OpenMidLeft]Very well. Let us ride![A][X]

[LoadLeft]Georgios, how is it outside?[A][X]
[LoadRight]It's crawling with those...[NL]
those things![A][NL]
They look like regular folk,[NL]
but they don't act like 'em.[A][X]
[LoadFarLeft]We've been holed up here for[NL]
over four days.[A][NL]
We've already gone through the smoked[NL]
trout and all that's left is stale bread.[A][NL]
We have enough water for maybe[NL]
twelve more hours.[A][X]
[LoadLeft]What are you saying then?[A][X]
[LoadFarLeft]We're doomed.[A][NL]
That is, doomed to face our fate[NL]
unless we act.[A][X]
[LoadRight]Easy for you to say, Vulture.[A][NL]
Neritas and I can cross swords with[NL]
these bizarre beasts.[A][NL]
You tell us how many minutes we[NL]
have until we starve![A][X]
[LoadLeft]Georgios! There is no need for that.[NL]
We must stick together.[A][NL]
Vulture, you know how to heal, right?[A][X]
[LoadFarLeft]It's one of my hobbies, yes.[A][X]
[LoadRight]Well, it's going to need to become[NL]
more than a pastime.[A][NL]
The only way out of this is[NL]
through them.[A][NL]
I'd rather die fighting than wither[NL]
here like a grape in summertime.[A][X]
[LoadLeft]Yes, we need to get to the Duke.[NL]
He may take us in.[A][X]
[LoadFarLeft]Hm? Do you hear that?[A][NL]
It sounds like horses... many horses.[A][X]
[LoadRight]Perhaps the Duke is here to save us?[NL]
Good fortune may be smiling on us.[A][X]
[LoadLeft]Then let us not reject its[NL]
kindess, then.[A][NL]
Georgios, you and I take the point.[NL]
Vulture, make sure we don't die.[A][NL]
Come on, let's go.[A][X]

## Ch2EndingSceen
[LoadLeft][LoadEsme][LoadRight][LoadNeritas][LoadFarLeft][LoadSolomin][LoadFarLeft][LoadGeorgios]
[LoadRight]We are grateful for your help.[NL]
You arrived at the perfect time.[A][X]
[LoadLeft]I'm glad it worked out.[A][NL]
Tell me, were there any other survivors?[A][X]
[LoadFarRight]Very few besides us.[NL]
Only the villagers you see here.[A][NL]
Vulture is tending to them.[A][X]
[LoadFarLeft]These beasts have done a number[NL]
on this place.[A][NL]
Where is the Duke?[A][X]
[LoadRight]Our plan was to rendezvous with him.[NL]
Given the dire straits we're in,[A][NL]
we wanted to band together to get[NL]
strength in numbers.[A][NL]
We stopped here a few days ago,[NL]
but were quickly trapped by those things.[A][X]
[LoadFarRight]When we heard you arrive,[NL]
we thought it was the Duke's men.[A][NL]
We certainly didn't expect House Luiza[NL]
to come to our aid.[A][NL]
... Not to say we aren't grateful, of course.[A][X]
[LoadFarLeft]... [A][X]
[LoadLeft]... You said you were to visit the Duke?[NL]
So, he still lives, to your knowledge?[A][X]
[LoadRight]That's right.[A][NL]
The Duke put out a call to all able-bodied[NL]
people in his domain to come to his manse.[A][NL]
He intends to rebuild his strength.[A][X]
[LoadFarRight]The soldiers who informed us were killed.[NL]
We were ambushed a week ago.[A][NL]
There were over a dozen of us[NL]
when we got together.[A][NL][CloseEyes]
Malachy, Zorba, Girgensons,[NL]
Greenwald, Longjian, Volos...[A][NL]
... Too many to name.[A][OpenEyes]
[LoadRight]We'd only known each other for a few days,[NL]
but the shared traums of this...[A][NL]
it brought us close.[A][NL]
All of them, taken too soon.[A][X]
[LoadLeft]I am deeply sorry for your losses.[A][NL]
You still intend to go see the[NL]
Duke though, correct?[A][NL]
Perhaps we can be your escort.[A][X]
[LoadRight]... We know the way.[A][X]
[LoadLeft]Then it is settled.[NL]
We'll travel together to the Duke.[A][X]
[LoadFarLeft]Take only what's needed.[NL]
Discard the rest.[A][X]
[LoadLeft]You both look famished.[A][NL]
Solomin, make sure these three get[NL]
a proper meal.[A][NL]
Solomin caught a quail earlier.[NL]
I trust this is acceptable?[A][NL]
[LoadFarRight][CloseEyes]Truly... we've been saved.[NL]
Thank you, Lady Esme.[A][X]
